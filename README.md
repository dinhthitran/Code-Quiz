Homework Assignment #4 Monash Bootcamp 2021 - Code-Quiz

This week's project was designed as a homework assignment for Monash Coding Bootcamp 2021.

The assignment homework is to build a timed coding quiz with multip-choice questions. It features dynamically updated HTML, CSS, powered by Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct, this then generates a score and then results from the user data. 

It includes a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
